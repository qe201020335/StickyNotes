# StickyNotes
A frontend JavaScript library that makes notes taking easier on webpage for the user

This library will add sticky notes to a webpage that allows users to take notes while browsing this page. It also allows the developer to add sticky notes with predefined contents in them without having the user take notes themselves. This library can be used in article and guide website where taking notes will greatly imporoves users' experience. The website developer can add a note to each section of the page/article/guide by letting the user click a button or triggering on other events. The content of an instance will not lose if the user close the note. It will appear again when the same instance is added back to the DOM.

## Example Demo Page
The example usage page is deployed [here](https://stickynotesdemo-309-sky.herokuapp.com/). <br>
This webpage contains a slightly long article as a demostration for the library. The content of the article is the industry standard **Lorem Ipsum**. There are several buttons that open a specific sticky note instance which is the entry point to this library.
