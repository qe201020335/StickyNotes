# StickyNotes
A frontend JavaScript library that makes notes taking easier on webpage

## Purpose and Features
This library will add sticky notes to a webpage that allows users to take notes while browsing this page. It also allows the developer to add sticky notes with predefined contents in them without having the user take notes themselves. An instance of a sticky note can be placed anywhere on the screen and can be dragged by the user. The developer can also change the content in a note and move it on the fly. A sticky note will have a save button to allow the user to download the note. <p>
This may sound like a browser extension that just allows note-taking in general. However, a web developer does not have access to the user's browser extension. This library allows the developer to show notes for the user and dynamically change the content in a note. By using this library, the developer doesn't need to worry about how to set up the CSS for the notes and precisely calculate the desired location. The location of a sticky note can be easily defined by just `top-right`, `bottom-left` and the library will do the rest for you.

## Example Use Cases
For a research article hosting website, the developer can add a sticky note to an article page that allows the user to take short notes while reading the article. The developer can also add the abstract of each section to the note when the user finishes reading a section. <p>
For an online tutorial/guide website, the developer can add shortened bullet form steps to a note and show the note when the user finishes reading. This makes sure the user keeps in mind the steps of the guide and can be prepared when they actually follow the guide. <p>
For an online learning platform, sticky notes can be used for interactive learning where notes containing some questions can be shown when the user finishes learning a part. Then the user can think about the question and write the answer in the note and download it for later review.
